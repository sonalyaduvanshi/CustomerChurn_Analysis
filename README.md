"Customer Churn Analysis Project"

 Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer churn, identifying patterns, and providing insights that can help businesses reduce churn. The analysis is performed using a combination of "Python", "Excel", and "Power BI" to process, visualize, and present the findings in an interactive way.

Key Objectives

The goal of this project was to:
- Analyze the customer churn data to understand which factors contribute to a customer leaving a service.
- Develop a Python script to clean, preprocess, and generate features for analysis.
- Create an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize the insights.

 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python : Data cleaning, feature engineering, and preprocessing using libraries like "pandas" and "numpy".
- Excel : Storing the cleaned and processed dataset to be used for further analysis and visualizations.
- Power BI : Creating interactive, easy-to-understand dashboards with dynamic slicers to explore churn patterns.

 Features of the Project

- Data Preprocessing : Cleaned the raw data by handling missing values, normalizing formats, and converting categorical variables.
- Feature Engineering : Added new columns like "AgeGroup", "TenureGroup", "UsageGroup", and "SupportRisk" to categorize customers and identify patterns.
- Power BI Dashboard : Built an interactive dashboard showing churn patterns across various customer segments (Age, Tenure, Usage, Support Calls). Users can filter the data by categories to explore insights.

Key Insights

- Age Group : Younger customers tend to have higher churn rates compared to older customers.
- Support Calls : Customers who frequently call support have a higher likelihood of churning.
- Tenure : Customers with longer tenure (subscription length) are less likely to churn, indicating the importance of long-term relationships.
  
Files Included

- CustomerChurn_Final.xlsx : The final cleaned dataset after processing and feature engineering. Ready for analysis in Power BI.
- CustomerChurn_Analysis.py : Python script used for preprocessing and feature engineering the data.
- CustomerChurn_Dashboard.pbix : Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard with various churn visualizations.

How to Use This Project

1. The "CustomerChurn_Final.xlsx" can be opened directly in Excel to explore the processed data.
2. The "CustomerChurn_Dashboard.pbix" should be opened in Power BI to interact with the dashboard and view the churn insights.
3. The "CustomerChurn_Analysis.py"script can be run in any Python environment (Jupyter, VS Code) to replicate the preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

Conclusion

This project highlights the importance of understanding customer churn for businesses. The insights derived from the analysis, especially the visual representation of churn across different customer segments, can help businesses take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.
